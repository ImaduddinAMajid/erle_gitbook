### A new robot system
We've been working hard for the last year to provide not just some fancy hardware, but a whole robot system that includes hardware, software and the tools neccesary to learn how to use it.


### A learning platform
We believe that free exchange of ideas is critical to creating an environment where people are allowed to learn and use existing information toward creating new ideas. Thereby, this is an Open Source Initiative (OSI) with global scope bringed to educate, teach and inspire about robotics.

Erle is a fully capable computer that can run general purpose operative systems such as Windows Embedded CE, Linux kernel-based file systems (Android, Ångström, Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, ArchLinux, Gentoo, ...) and well known frameworks in robotics such as the Robot Operative System (ROS).


### Low cost robot
None of this will make sense if the robot's price is out of bounds regarding price. We decided to put special effort in coming up with a price that is affordable to everybody.
In order to do that, we've been working hard for the last year to provide not just some fancy hardware, but a whole robot system that includes hardware, software and the tools neccesary to learn how to use it.


## So, how do i get started with all this?

Well, start [pre-ordering](http://erlerobot.com/preorder.html) our robot and we will let you know when we are ready ;).
