#Sensors


Below the sensors included in [Erle's board](http://erlerobot.com) are described:

## Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs)

| **Sensor**   | **Features** |
|----|---------|
| *MPU6000* | AM3359, ARM Cortex A8 720MHz |
| *MPU9150* | TPS65217B, Power Regulators, LiION Single cell |
| *MPU9250* |  256MB DDR2 400MHz|
| *LSM9DS0* | USB to Serial Adapter, On Board JTAG via USB|

## Barometers

| **Sensor**   | **Features** |
|----|---------|
| * MS5611-01BA03* | AM3359, ARM Cortex A8 720MHz |
| *BMP250* | TPS65217B, Power Regulators, LiION Single cell |


## Why so many sensors?

Well, think about the possibilities of using new algorithms and control techniques with many sources of information.

We believe that the lack of precision can be greatly compensated with the quantity we provide achieving both an affordable price and amazing results ;).
